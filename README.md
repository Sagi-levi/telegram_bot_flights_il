# telegram_bot_flights_il
In this project, we practice a bot building on a telegram platform using python, the system should help the customer to find the cheapest flight to his destination with an easy friendly user interface.
this way we can help people who struggle to use google and the flight ordering websites and only show them what they really need.
since it's a server repo the only way to see the result is using telegram.
I'm open-minded to new ideas and features.
